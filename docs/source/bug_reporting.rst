Bug reports
===========

Security Issues
---------------

If you think that an issue with nitrate may have security implications, please do not publically report it in the bug tracker, mailing lists, or irc. Nitrate has a dedicated process for handling (potential) security issues that should be used instead. So if your issue has security implications, ignore the rest of this page and follow the security process instead.


General nitrate bug reports 
---------------------------

The `Red Hat Bugzilla Server  <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/>`_ should be used to report bugs and request features in nitrate. Before submitting a ticket, check the existing tickets to see if the bug/feature is already tracked. 

It's always a good idea to file bug reports, as the process of filing the report always makes it easier to describe the problem, and the bug number provides a quick way of referring to the problem. However, not everybody in the community pays attention to bugzilla, so after you file a bug, asking questions and submitting patches on the nitrate mailing lists will increase your bug's visibility and encourage people to think about your problem. Don't hesitate to ask questions on the list, as others may know of existing solutions or be interested in collaborating with you on finding a solution. Patches are always appreciated, and it's likely that someone else has the same problem you do!

If you decide to write code, though, before you begin please read the contributor guidelines, especially the first point: "Discuss any large changes on the mailing list first. Post patches early and listen to feedback." Few development experiences are more discouraging than spending a bunch of time writing a patch only to have someone point out a better approach on list.
